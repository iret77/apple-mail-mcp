"""Account name ↔ UUID mapping for FTS5 search filters.

The disk indexer stores account UUIDs from filesystem paths
(e.g., "24E569DF-5E45-...") but users pass friendly names
(e.g., "Work") from JXA. This module bridges the gap.

Usage:
    acct_map = AccountMap.get_instance()
    await acct_map.ensure_loaded()
    uuid = acct_map.name_to_uuid("Work")   # → "24E569DF-..."
    name = acct_map.uuid_to_name("24E5...")  # → "Work"
