"""Direct reads against Apple's Envelope Index SQLite.

Used by the Strategy-0 fast paths in `list_accounts()` and
`get_emails()`. Skips JXA round-trips entirely by querying the
same SQLite database BastianZim/rusty/pl-lyfx read.

The Envelope Index lives at
`~/Library/Mail/V<N>/MailData/Envelope Index` and is maintained
by Mail.app. It uses lookup tables for high-cardinality string
columns (`messages.subject` is an FK into `subjects.ROWID`;
`messages.sender` is an FK into `addresses.ROWID`), and stores
read/flagged/deleted as direct integer columns on `messages`,
which lets us serve every `get_emails()` filter without a JXA
fallback for live state.

Account display names are NOT stored in this database. The
caller (server.py) resolves account name -> mailbox-URL UUID via
the AccountMap singleton, which is hydrated from the
`list_accounts()` tool's JXA call. So this module deals in UUIDs
on the way in (when resolving a target mailbox) and emits
display names on the way out via the same AccountMap.
